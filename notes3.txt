In the previous section I showed that ordering lexical paraphrases of semantic relations using a simple Bayesian probability maximization method is effective at reproducing the order of frequency with which such paraphrases were produced by human volunteers. This method is only useful in situations where a list of possible paraphrases is available, but the frequency with which each is produced is not available. In real world tasks, a more common problem is to try to deduce what kind of lexical relations would be appropriate to describe the semantic relation between two words.

Recruiting human annotators to provide relations is time consuming. For automatic relation exctraction, a common approach (Pantel, Kim, Nakov) has been to use a large corpus to extract relations by finding sentences in the corpus where the relation between the two words is explicit. Even with very large corpora however, coverage is poor - the number of sentences containing a useful explicit lexical relation between two specific nouns is low.

[here goes statistic on coverage for google ngrams by me and another paper]
[note - coverage for abstract relation classification systems is accuracy - 65% for 6 relations - anything bigger than this is an improvement]
